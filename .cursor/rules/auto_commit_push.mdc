# Agent Rules for Theramin Project

## Auto-commit and Push
- **IMPORTANT**: After making any code changes, the agent MUST commit and push them automatically
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed
- Always push to the remote repository after committing
- The user should never need to manually commit or push agent changes

## Commit Message Format
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Format: "Agent: [brief description of changes]"
- Example: "Agent: Add recording functionality to Controls component"
